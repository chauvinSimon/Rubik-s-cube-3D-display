## Getting Started

### Decide which representation you want to use for encoding the color:
Two string representations are possible:
- if using the notation where the unfolded cube is read block by block (U + R + F + D + L + B), run it directly
- if using the notation where the unfolded cube is read line by line, comment/uncomment the related line in [display3D.py](display3D.py)

### Run
Run [main.py](main.py)

## Prerequisites

Python3 with Matplolibs
